🔢 Operations of Sets in Python

Set operations in Python are mathematical operations used to compare, combine, and analyze sets.
Below are ALL set operations, explained clearly, exam-ready, and with examples ✅

📌 1. Union ( | or union() )

Combines elements from both sets (no duplicates).

A = {1, 2, 3}
B = {3, 4, 5}

print(A | B)
print(A.union(B))


📤 Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

📌 2. Intersection ( & or intersection() )

Returns common elements in both sets.

print(A & B)
print(A.intersection(B))


📤 Output: {3}

📌 3. Difference ( - or difference() )

Elements present in first set but not in second.

print(A - B)
print(A.difference(B))


📤 Output: {1, 2}

📌 4. Symmetric Difference ( ^ or symmetric_difference() )

Elements present in either set but NOT in both.

print(A ^ B)
print(A.symmetric_difference(B))


📤 Output: {1, 2, 4, 5}

📌 5. Subset ( <= or issubset() )

Checks if all elements of one set exist in another.

C = {1, 2}

print(C <= A)
print(C.issubset(A))


📤 Output: True

📌 6. Superset ( >= or issuperset() )

Checks if a set contains all elements of another set.

print(A >= C)
print(A.issuperset(C))


📤 Output: True

📌 7. Disjoint Sets ( isdisjoint() )

Checks if two sets have NO common elements.

D = {6, 7}

print(A.isdisjoint(D))


📤 Output: True

📌 8. Membership (in, not in)

Checks if an element exists in a set.

print(2 in A)
print(9 not in A)


📤 Output:
True
True

📌 9. Equality ( == )

Checks if two sets contain the same elements.

X = {1, 2, 3}
Y = {3, 2, 1}

print(X == Y)


📤 Output: True

📌 10. Set Length (len() )

Returns number of elements in a set.

print(len(A))
