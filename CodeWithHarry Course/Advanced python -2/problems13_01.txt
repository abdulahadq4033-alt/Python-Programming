1. Create two virtual environments, install few packages in the first one. How do you
create a similar environment in the second one?


# Creating Similar Virtual Environments in Python

This README explains how to create **two virtual environments** and make the second one **exactly the same** as the first using the `pip freeze` command.

---

## Step 1: Create the First Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv env1
```

Activate it (Windows – CMD):

```bash
env1\Scripts\activate.bat
```

---

## Step 2: Install Packages in the First Environment

Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas requests
```

---

## Step 3: Save Installed Packages Using `pip freeze`

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

This creates a file named `requirements.txt` containing all installed packages and their exact versions.

Example:

```text
numpy==1.26.4
pandas==2.2.1
requests==2.31.0
```

---

## Step 4: Create the Second Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv env2
```

Activate it:

```bash
env2\Scripts\activate.bat
```

---

## Step 5: Install the Same Packages in the Second Environment

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now, **env2 has the same packages and versions as env1**.

---

## One-Line Explanation (Exam Ready)

> A similar virtual environment is created by generating a `requirements.txt` file using `pip freeze` in the first environment and installing those dependencies in the second environment using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

---

## Why This Method Is Used

* Ensures identical package versions
* Prevents dependency conflicts
* Commonly used in real-world projects and deployment
