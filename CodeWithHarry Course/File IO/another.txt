I'm biding my time at the end of the line
No compromise in sight
So I'll walk through the fire
Break through the blinds to find my desire
But I'm slipping back again, back to the start again
Back where I ought've been
Feels like the tide is turnin' back again
No sign of settlin', just like there's never been
Sounds like the record's broken
It's been up and down, but I know I'm fine
I'll take my time
I'm alive
I've been justified, I
Panic attack
I'm slippin' through the cracks
Everything's turning black
Still don't know how I'm gonna make it back
Back to the other side, back where the others lie
Feels like it always drags me back again
Back to the start again, back where I ought've been
Feels like the clock keeps turnin' back again
Back where it all began, comin' around again
Yeah but I know this time
I'm alive
And it feels like I'm on fire
But it's right on time
I'm alive
But it feels like I'm on fire
And it's right on time
I'm alive
I've been justified, I
It's a dizzy dive but I'll survive
As noise around me grows louder
I've been up and down but now I'm fine
I know this time
I'm alive
I've been justified, I
I'm alive
And it feels like I'm on fire
But it's right on time
I'm alive
But it feels like I'm on fire
And it's right on time
